# Prachalit_Lipi_Character_Recognition

Many manuscripts and inscriptions were written historically, spanning several centuries
in Kathmandu valley, by the indigenous Newar people, who developed their own alpha-
betic writing system. The process of identification and recognition is an difficult task.
So, due to recent developments in AI, many languages and scripts have developed the
Optical Character Recognition for recognizing the handwritten scripts and digitizing the
script through the use of VGG Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Thus, to develop
OCR for Newari language and subsequent scripts used, we have prepared the project
”Prachalit Lipi Character Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network”
